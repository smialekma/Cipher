## General info
This project is a simple command-line app allowing for text encryption and decryption using ROT13 and ROT47 ciphers (Ceasar cipher) with extra file handling functionality.
The texts might be decoded/encoded both directly from json file and from user input - and bulk-saved to another (or the same) json file.
Thanks to implementing the best coding practices and design patterns (Facade/Factory) this project is easily modifiable and extendable (for example, with different kinds of ciphers).
